# Examples for MATLAB

Welcome to the ExamplesMatlab repository, where you can find a series of MATLAB examples designed to help you learn how to interact with the QServer API.

If you are new to QServer and are starting from scratch, we recommend that you begin with the "Basic" examples, which are organized to gradually build your understanding. To get the most out of these examples, follow them in the sequence listed below:
1) BasicsItemList - Start with this example to learn how to read and understand the list of items from QServer. It lays the foundation for interacting with the QServer REST API, demonstrating how to fetch and parse data from the server.
2) BasicsConfigureItems - Once you are comfortable with retrieving the item list, proceed to this example to learn how to configure the items' operation modes and settings. This example builds upon the concepts introduced in the BasicsItemList example and guides you through making changes to the QServer configuration.
3) BasicsStreamingData - This example will show you how to handle streaming data from QServer, focusing on establishing a stream connection and processing real-time data. It is the next step in learning after you have mastered item list retrieval and configuration.

By following these examples in order, you will gain the knowledge needed to perform basic operations and set a solid foundation for more complex interactions with QServer using MATLAB.

Best of luck on your learning journey with QServer and MATLAB! For continued learning and more advanced examples, feel free to explore the rest of this repository.
